# Simulation of clinical trials in oncology

This repository contains all code related to the article [Why effect sizes are systematically larger for progression-free survival than overall survival in cancer drug trials: prognostic scores as a way forward](https://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(24)01713-1/fulltext) (L Locher, M Serra-Burriel, D Trapani, E Nussli & KN Vokinger, 2024). For more detailed information, please refer to the article.

The subfolder '/application' contains the code for the published [shiny application](https://lulocher.shinyapps.io/oncology-trial-simulator/). The subfolder './examples' contains the code that produced the examples in the article. Please note that the code underlying the simulation is duplicated in the two folders due to issues with the deployment of the shiny application.

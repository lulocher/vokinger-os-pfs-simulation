# Simulation of clinical trials for cancer drugs
This repository contains all code related to the paper "Why effect sizes are systematically larger for PFS than for OS in clinical trials for cancer drugs" by Locher, Serra-Burriel, Nussli & Vokinger (unpublished manuscript). For more detailed information, please refer to the [paper](add link).

The subfolder '/application' contains the code for the published [shiny application](add link). The subfolder './examples' contains the code that produced the examples in the paper. Please note that the code underlying the simulation is duplicated in the two folders due to issues with the deployment of the shiny application.
